Project Plan: ContextED Mapper
1. Executive Summary
ContextED Mapper is an innovative web application designed to empower educators, social workers, and community leaders in Helsingborg (and eventually, other regions) with a powerful tool to understand and leverage local socio-political data. By visualizing community resources and demographic information on an interactive map, and integrating engaging gamification features, this platform aims to foster data-informed decision-making, enhance resource allocation, and strengthen community collaboration to improve educational outcomes for students.
2. Problem Statement
Educators and social support professionals often lack accessible, localized, and easily digestible data to understand the broader socio-political context impacting their students and school communities. This gap can hinder targeted interventions, efficient resource allocation, and a holistic understanding of community needs, ultimately affecting educational effectiveness and student well-being.
3. The Solution: ContextED Mapper
ContextED Mapper will bridge this gap by providing an intuitive platform where users can:
* Visually Map Resources: Identify and locate local community assets like libraries, health clinics, food banks, after-school programs, and green spaces.

* Overlay Socio-Political Data: Visualize demographic information (e.g., population density, income levels, language diversity) in relation to schools and resources.

* Contribute Local Insights: Share qualitative observations and community narratives, enriching the data with on-the-ground perspectives.

* Engage through Gamification: Participate in challenges and contribute data, earning points and recognition individually and as a school community.

4. Key Features
* Interactive Geospatial Mapping: Dynamic map interface displaying multiple data layers (resources, demographics, school zones).

* Community Data Contribution: User-friendly tools for submitting new resources, verifying existing data, and adding qualitative "Community Narratives."

* Data Analysis & Correlation: Functionality to explore relationships between different data layers (e.g., resource availability vs. socio-economic indicators).

* Secure User Management: Robust authentication and authorization system for different user roles (e.g., educators, community admins).

* Content Moderation: System for administrators to review and approve user-generated content.

5. Gamification Strategy
To maximize engagement and data contribution, ContextED Mapper will incorporate a gamification approach focused on collective effort:
* School Leaderboard Gamification ("Community Impact Cup"):
    * Schools, as collective entities, compete or collaborate to enrich data relevant to their students. The leaderboard will be calculated based on a composite score that includes both the quantity and quality of data contributions, as well as an anonymized, aggregated metric of the average academic performance (e.g., student grades) of the school's students.

    * Contributions made by users associated with a specific school count towards that school's collective score.

    * School Leaderboards will highlight which schools are making the most significant impact in data contribution and educational improvement, fostering friendly competition and collective effort. This will also be a key data point tracked in the system.

6. Technical Stack
* Backend: Node.js with Express.js for building a robust and scalable API.

* Database: Supabase, leveraging its hosted PostgreSQL database for a structured, relational approach. Its built-in authentication and real-time capabilities will be used for seamless interaction and data management. All geospatial data and queries will utilize the PostGIS extension.

* Mapping Library: Leaflet.js for interactive map rendering on the frontend.

* Frontend Framework: Angular for a dynamic and structured user experience.

7. Data Sources
The platform will primarily source its datasets from publicly available data and APIs. This includes, but is not limited to, open data portals from the city of Helsingborg, national government open data initiatives, and public APIs from relevant community organizations.
8. Expected Impact & Benefits
* Enhanced Local Understanding: Provides educators with unprecedented, localized insight into factors affecting their students in Helsingborg.

* Data-Driven Interventions: Enables more precise and effective resource allocation and program development.

* Stronger Community Bonds: Fosters collaboration among schools, families, and local organizations.

* Empowered Professionals: Equips educators and social workers with concrete data to advocate for their communities.

* Increased Data Literacy: Promotes active engagement with and understanding of socio-political data.

* Sustainable Data Growth: Gamification incentivizes continuous, community-driven data collection.

9. Call to Action for Collaborators
We are seeking passionate individuals who are eager to contribute to a project with significant social impact. We are looking for expertise in:
* Backend Development (Node.js/Express.js/Supabase)

* Frontend Development (Angular, Leaflet.js)

* UI/UX Design

* Data Science/Analysis

* Educational or Social Sector Expertise
